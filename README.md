# FedoraQuest
Remake using RenPy!

# Plot
FedoraQuest is a game about a person who goes on a quest. That's about it really. It is developed by <s> a bunch of friends who thought 'why not' </s> highly advanced and professional game developers who did not initially plan it as a joke. FedoraQuest tells a truly 'inspiring' and 'meaningful' story that we can all learn a lesson from.
# Releases
The game is still very much in alpha with nothing really yet, but I will add the .rpa files when the game has some playable content if anybody wants to download them

Also, as annoying as it may be, for FedoraQuestUI to run properly <b>ALL</b> the files need to be extracted, and in the same directory (folder.) If you have found any bugs, please be sure to report them in the issues section. Thanks!

You dont need that good specs really. As long as you have 50mb of storage, python 3 or higher downloaded and Ren'Py you're good to go! Compiled releases may be released later on which won't require any extra packages.
